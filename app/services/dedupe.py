"""Duplicate-resume policy, judged per job description.

Same person = same email OR same phone. Then, for one job:

  - resume text different                    -> CONFLICT    (hold as pending; applicant chooses)
  - no active application for this job yet   -> NEW_APPLICATION (other-job resumes are fine)
  - person unknown                           -> NEW_CANDIDATE
