- Use ONLY information present in the text. Never invent values. Use null (or [] for lists) when absent.
- Copy email and phone exactly as written.
- skills: individual skills/technologies, one per string. Ignore category labels
  ("Languages:", "GenAI (Working Knowledge):"). Keep parenthetical groups intact only as separate skills:
  "Power BI (DAX, Power Query)" -> "Power BI", "DAX", "Power Query". Put level qualifiers such as
  "(Basic)" or "working knowledge" in skill_levels, not in the skill name. Exclude spoken languages and
  fragments that are not skills (e.g. "Fundamentals", "Strong Debugging"). Do NOT put soft skills here.
- soft_skills: interpersonal/behavioural skills (communication, teamwork, leadership, adaptability,
  problem solving, time management). Keep them out of `skills`.
- skill_levels: object mapping a skill name to "basic" | "working" when the resume says so; else {}.
- internships: internships/trainee/apprentice roles, same shape as experience items. Keep them OUT of `experience`.
- experience_years: total years of paid, full-time professional employment as a number. Internships,
  training and academic projects do NOT count. Estimate from job date ranges if not stated; use 0 when
  the resume has no employment (freshers, "no work experience"); null only if truly undeterminable.

  unit testing, REST API design, data preprocessing, feature engineering, Agile, CI/CD: recruiters search for them.
- Never create vague single-word skills (e.g. "Metrics", "Design"); keep multi-word skills whole.
- replace_skill: use to split or clean a combined skill, e.g. old "RAG & vector databases" -> "RAG"
  (then add_skill "Vector Databases"). One skill per string.
- add_skill: a clearly listed technical skill that was missed.
- set: fix a wrong scalar. experience_years counts paid full-time employment only, never internships.
  Change experience_years ONLY when the resume states the number of years or gives date ranges; a range like

TOOLS:
{catalog}

Rules:
- Pick the tool(s) that answer the question; use several calls if the question has several parts (max 4).
- Copy candidate names EXACTLY as the user wrote them; the tools resolve them. NEVER pick between candidates yourself: if the
  user wrote only "Ananya" and two candidates are named Ananya, pass "Ananya" unchanged so the tool can ask which one.
- Resolve follow-ups ("the second one", "him", "why?") using RECENT CONVERSATION; put the actual names in args.
- Skill names: use the standard name (e.g. "Machine Learning", "FastAPI", "Docker", "Computer Vision"). A NAMED skill or field goes to
  find_by_skill; use semantic_search only for a described activity with no standard skill name.
- If the question is small talk, unrelated to these candidates, or asks you to do something no tool supports,
  return "calls": [] and a short "direct_reply" saying what you can help with.
- Never invent tools.

Examples:
"Show me the top 5 candidates." -> {"calls":[{"tool":"top_candidates","args":{"n":5}}],"direct_reply":null}
"Who is the best candidate for this role?" -> {"calls":[{"tool":"top_candidates","args":{"n":1}}],"direct_reply":null}

  key skills present, and important missing skills, like: "X ranks higher because they match 9 of 10 required skills
  including Python and FastAPI; Y lacks Docker, which lowered their score."
- Skills marked "inferred" are implied by related tools the candidate lists, not stated; say "inferred from ..." when relevant.
- "experience_years" is paid employment only; mention internships separately when relevant.
- If a tool result contains an "error" with "problems": for "ambiguous" list the options and ask which one is meant; for
  "not_found" say the name was not found and list the available candidate names.
- semantic_search results are the CLOSEST matches by meaning, not guaranteed hits: say so, quote the relevant snippet, and never
  present a weak match as a confirmed skill. Matches are listed best-first; do not invent a numeric relevance score, and
  do not confuse similarity with the candidate's match score.
