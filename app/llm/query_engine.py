"""Natural-language question -> tool calls -> grounded answer.

1. PLAN    a fast LLM turns the question (plus recent chat) into JSON: which tools to call, with what arguments.
2. EXECUTE the code validates each call against the fixed tool registry and runs real SQL (query_tools.py).
3. ANSWER  a chat LLM writes the reply using ONLY the tool results.

The LLM never sees the database and never writes SQL. Because the plan is plain JSON, any provider works,
including the local Ollama model.
